          The first feature film made in India was Pundalik  by N.G. Chitre and R.G Torney which screened on the 18th of May, 1912.
          In the year of 1913, Dada Saheb Phalke made the first silent feature film Raja Harrishchandra.  This film is based on a popular story about an upright righteous ancient king and the sacrifices he made to remain firm in his convictions.  While Pundalik is India’s first feature-length film, Raja Harrishchandra  is the first full-length commercial Indian feature film.
        </p>
        <p>
          The response to this film was huge because for a movie viewer, it was a surreal moment to see an imagined past become real.  The success of this film prompted Phalke to form a company by the name of Hindustan Films and made two other feature films Mohini Bhamasur and Satyavan Savitri.
          Phalke proved that making films and screening them for a paying audience was a profitable business venture and attracted new investors.

        </p>
        <p>
          Films made in Hollywood were a main point of reference but themes were adapted to suit the Indian viewer.
          In 1936, Himanshu Rai set up the famous Bombay Talkies, which was a studio for establishing the ever-popular genres of musical romance and melodrama. Indian cinema has six influences when making films. These six are: stories from Indian mythology, folk theatres, the Parsee theatre, Hollywood films, and the Western Musical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around this time, India was still ruled by the British, but the British government introduced the Indian Cinematograph Act. This act provided censorship and licensing that would control the contents of a film.
          The silent era of Indian film history was not necessarily “silent.” Live music bands accompanies film in order to make the experience more unique different for viewers.

       <p>The era of silent films ended with the release of Alam Ara in 1931, India’s first sound film and opened new avenues for Indian cinema.</p>
        <p>  With sound, came the experience of music and songs as an integral part of cinema. Alam Ara had six songs and ever since then Indian movies and songs have gone hand in hand. I like to believe that music makes up a huge part of a Bollywood film in order to distinguish themselves from other film industries. </p>
        <p>The reason behind the inclusion of songs in Indian films is because songs and singing are a huge part of Indian Life. They are used during birth, marriage, festivals, seasons, and rituals and are all celebrated with music. </p>
        <p>
        Songs in Indian cinema are a part of the whole package of cinematic entertainment and has generated a parallel industry with songwriter, music composers, musicians, singers, music companies and recording studios.
        With the addition of songs comes the addition of dance and has led to a subsidiary industry today with choreographers, dancers, trainers, and dance schools.  </p>
        <p>Both music and dances have their roots in both classical and folk-dance traditions in India and other countries too.
        In the 1930s and 1940s India had a lot going on with the Great Depression, World War II, and the Indian Independence Movement and Violent Partition. </p>
        <p>
        Most Bollywood films were a means to escape everything that was going on, but filmmakers also used film to take a close look at society and its problems and the need for reformation.
        In 1937, the first color Hindi Film, Kisan Kanya was made, but it did not fully become popular until the late 1950s.</p>

    <div class = "col m6" id = "silentInfo">
      <p>Following India’s Independence, the period from 1940s to 1960s was known as the Golden Age of Hindi Cinema.  Filmmakers were touched by this new hope of a better society that would remain ethically and moral strong, but also looking forward and modern. </p>
      <p>
      Some of the most critically acclaimed Hindi Films of all time were produced during this time.  Some examples are Guru Dutt films like Pyassa and Kaagaz Ke Phool, Raj Kapoor films like Awaara and Shree 420, and Dilip Kumar’s Aan. These films expressed social regeneration and dealt with the working-class urban life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also some of the most epic films of Hindi cinema made during the time. Such as, Mehboob Khan’s Mother India which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and K. Asif’s Mughal-e-Azam.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things that made Bollywood films more attractive were the performances given by its actors and actresses.  Some of the successful actors during this era include: Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt. Popular actresses include: Nargis, Vyjanthimala, Meena Kumari, Madhubala, Nut and an, and Waheeda Rahman.
    </p>
    <p>
    While commercial Hindi cinema was thriving, the 1950s also saw the emergence of a new Parallel Cinema movement.
    Though the movement was mainly led by Bengali cinema, it also began gaining prominence in Hindi cinema. </p>
    <p>
    Early examples of Hindi films in this movement include Chetan Anand's Neecha Nagar (1946)and Bimal Roy's Do Bigha Zamin (1953). Their critical acclaim, as well as the latter's commercial success, paved the way for Indian neorealism and the Indian New Wave.

      In the 1960s-70s saw the beginning of Masala Films. These films are high in action, romance, comedy, and music.
      There was also a lot of more experimentation with movie genres such as thrillers, action, romance and horror.</p>
      <p>
      <p>
      The term masala alludes to the whole range of genres and emotions that one can expect to find in a Bollywood film. They tend to be musicals that include songs filmed in picturesque locations.
      During this era it was the actors and actresses that drove people to see films. Popular actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, and Dharmendra. Some of the popular actress included Rekha, Zeenat Aman, and Hema Malini. </p>
    </p>
      Manmohan Desai was one of the more successful Bollywood directors and is considered as the “father” of Masala film. The idea behind the movies during this era was to take people to a different place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 1970s there was a rise in commercial cinema in the form of films like Sholay which is one of the best Bollywood films in history and still remains popular even today.
      The most internationally acclaimed Hindi Film of the 1980s was Salaam Bombay!, which also won at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.
    </p>
    <p>
    Masala films are still very much alive in today's Bollywood cinema. Some of the recent masala films have starred some of Bollywood's biggest actors and actresses. Some recent examples would be films like Dabangg, Chennai Express, Rowdy Rathore, etc.

      <p>In the late 1980s-2000s, Bollywood films went back to being family centric romantic musicals and comedies. During this era, stars like Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, and Ajay Devgan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2000s saw a growth in Bollywood's recognition across the world due to a growing and prospering NRI community.

      <p>
      These movies are the ones that a lot of us grow up with remembering such as Main Pyar Kiya, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayange (which is Bollywood’s longest running film), Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. This time period also gave us legendary actresses like Madhuri Dixit, Kajol, Karishma Kapoor, Sridevi, and Juhi Chalwa.
      </p>
      <p>
      Today, Bollywood films have still retained its Masala genre, with some being huge commercial successes.Films have also done a lot of experimentation with plot, genre, music, and dance. Bollywood films are being produced more and more every year and have been.
    </p>
